Flux-Node Roadmap
=======

This is just an ideas and general todo list

### Current Tasks

## Chatrooms Mixin

A Basic irc inspired multi-room text chat server mixin.  Allows nick registration, room creation and removal and customisable authority levels.

### Todo List

## Serial Tunnel

FluxNode communication via serial ports.  This will be the basis for allowing the creation of nodes that emit events coming from custom hardware.

## Arduino Firmata mixin

Mixin allowing for emitting events coming from an arduino utilising the firmata framework

## Redis Tunnel

Redis based tunnel for communicating between nodes running in different processes on the same machine
